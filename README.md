# Node Modules Cleanup Script

This Python script helps you find and potentially delete "node_modules" folders, which are commonly associated with Node.js projects. It calculates the size of each "node_modules" folder and provides an option to delete them.

**Note: Be cautious when deleting files and folders from your system. Always have a backup of important data before proceeding.**

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Download the script file `delete_node_modules.py` from this repository.

3. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located (make sure ypu put the script at the root of your system or the root of all your projects).

4. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```shell
   python delete_node_modules.py
